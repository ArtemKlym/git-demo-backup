sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

For the grace, for the might of our lord
In the name of his glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story again

They’re the guard of the Holy See
They’re the guards of Christianity
Their path to history is paved with salvation
